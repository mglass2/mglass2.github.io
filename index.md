## Questions

Below are some common questions that I've either asked or been asked on interviews.

**What motivates you?**
Creating a solution that genuinely improves a process or outcome.  Especially when it involves the human element of improving someone's job.
Management that prioritizes the most impactful work and deprioritizes distractions.

**What demotivates you?**
Wasted time: Unclear or habitually changing priorities, over-reliance on meeting culture, busy-work culture.
Being micro-managed.
Responsibility for lots of administrative/managerial tasks.

**What are you learning recently?**
Python, Jekyll, Ollama (running AI models locally), AI/LLM coding assistants, Google Cloud API scripting to consolidate 20 years of digital photographs stored in multiple locations.

**What DevOps experience do you have?**
I've never worked full time in a DevOps role, but do have working knowledge of common DevOps concepts such as Linux, Docker, Git, containerization, logging, networking, etc.  A large part of my last role involved working with with an internal DevOps team to deploy software to our hosting environment and solve problems/bugs where necessary.

**What software languages are you comfortable using?**
Professionally, I've released software to production in PHP and C#.  Personally, I'm learning Python and would welcome the chance to get more experience with it. 
AI coding tools have made it dramatically faster and easier to become proficient in a new language.  Once someone is familiar with the structures/patterns/concepts that are present in modern languages, 

**What do you want in your employment?**
- The ability to work on challenging and meaningful problems.
- A team with a good mix of skills, where ownership is distributed among team members.
- Fair compensation.  I value flexibility and retirement benefits over total compensation.

**What do you *not* want in your employment?**
Lots of managerial or administrative responsibilities.  I enjoy mentoring and collaborating with other developers - but I don't want to negotiate salary/benefits, debate PTO requests, or do performance reviews.

**How do you use AI/LLM coding assistants?**
Almost like an always available, expert-level pair programmer.  When properly managed, it can really speed up development time and automate a lot of monotonous tasks.  AI coding assistants are also *by far* the best way to learn new languages/packages/concepts.

**Describe a project on which you made a significant technical impact?**
At a former employer, an ETL process that populated a large data warehouse had to run in a specific time window overnight.  User growth had caused it to expand beyond that window.  The ETL process was written in an older PHP codebase.  I moved the ETL process to a C# microservice to take advantage of parallel processing, better database connection management, and more efficient resource usage.  The end result was a 5x performance improvement, far fewer instances of failure, and a more maintainable codebase.

**Describe a project on which you made a significant process impact?**
At a former employer, the business paid royalties when using third party content.  Royalties were calculated by a manual report, sometimes taking the Content Team and a Junior Developer almost a week to compile.  I worked with the Content and Finance Teams to fully automate the report logic, store the results in a database, and display the outcome in Qlik's visualization platform.  Compiling the report became an automated process that took less than an hour.  An additional benefit became the cost savings that were discovered by substituting content that required smaller royalty payments.

<!-- Web app to assign content via packaged grouping.

**How do you use technology in your personal life?**
I've used Linux (mostly Ubuntu) on my home computer for over a decade.  I also began using MacOS at home, after working at an employer that used Macbooks for all development.

**What do you do outside of work?**
I like to stay active and work with my hands - snowboarding, hockey, mountain biking, cooking, car maintenance, gardening, hiking. -->
