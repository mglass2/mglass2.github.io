## Small Businesses Waste Time on Manual Work
- Re-entering the same data into multiple systems  
- Manual invoicing, quoting, onboarding
- Endless spreadsheets, documents, and PDFs
- Processes that break because no one has time to maintain them  

I help eliminate these bottlenecks using automations that fit *your* workflow.

## What I Automate
- Data entry automation  
- Workflow triggers (emails, reminders, follow-ups)  
- Document generation (PDFs, quotes, reports)  
- Internal dashboards  
- Converting spreadsheets into simple internal apps  
- API integrations  
- Custom scripts for repetitive processes

2. **Plan** – Identify improvements and provide a clear, written quote for the solution.
3. **Build** – I create your automation 
4. **Delivery** – 
5. **Follow Up** -
