## Small Businesses Waste Time on Manual Work
- Re-entering the same data into multiple systems  
- Manual invoicing, quoting, onboarding  
- Endless spreadsheets  
- Processes that break because no one has time to fix them  

I help eliminate these bottlenecks using custom micro-automations that fit *your* workflow.

## What I Automate
- Data entry automation  
- Workflow triggers (emails, reminders, follow-ups)  
- Document generation (PDFs, quotes, reports)  
- Customer onboarding  
- Internal dashboards  
- Converting spreadsheets into simple internal apps  
- API integrations  
- Custom scripts for repetitive processes
